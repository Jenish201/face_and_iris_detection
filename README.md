# Real-Time Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascades. It captures live video feed from your webcam, detects faces and eyes, and draws bounding boxes around them.

## Features
- **Face Detection:** Detects faces in real-time using Haar Cascades.
- **Eye Detection:** Detects eyes within the detected faces.
- **Webcam Integration:** Captures live video from your webcam.
- **Bounding Boxes:** Draws bounding boxes around detected faces and eyes.
